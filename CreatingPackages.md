Creating Packages for The GHP is as Easy as Using Them. But, UnLike Usage,
It Requires a GitHub Account... But From The Good Side, That is The ONLY Thing Required.

Before Creating Something, You Must Imagine Yourself Static Initials - What will be The ``Owner`` in Terminology.

To Create a Package, You Create a GitHub Repository Named in The Format ``Python-[Owner]_[Name]``.
Inside That Repository, You Create a Folder Named ``[Owner]_[Name]`` in The ``main`` Branch.
That Folder is Where Your Code should be. GHP was Intended to be Cross-Platform,
so It's Better for You to Keep Your Package Cross-Platform too.
The Folder is What The GHP will Use (CheckSums, Installs, Etc) - That is Actually Very Useful.
Files Like ``README.md``, or Anything Else You DONT want to Include in Your Package
are to be Placed Anywhere Except That Folder.

For a Fully Functioning Example, See [The Example "Hello, World!" Package](https://github.com/KM-CM/Python-KM_CM_GitHubPackages_Example).
